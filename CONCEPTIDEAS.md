### **How to Obtain New Random Items**

**Mechanics:**

1. **Hat Pull Action:**
   - The player can perform a "Hat Pull" action to retrieve a random item.
   - This action can be initiated at any time but comes with constraints to balance gameplay.

2. **Constraints:**
   - **Cooldown Timer:** After each Hat Pull, there's a short cooldown before the next pull (e.g., 30 seconds).
   - **Limited Charges:** The hat has a limited number of pulls that recharge over time or through specific actions.
   - **Suspicion Increase:** Frequent item pulling increases a "Suspicion Meter," making it riskier to pull items in crowded areas.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Pull items when not in line-of-sight of NPCs to avoid suspicion.
   - Decide whether to save pulls for critical moments or use them liberally.
