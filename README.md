# Game Concept: HopShop Hattery

## Setting
Write down later.

## Gameplay:
- Wave based tower defense

### Core Loop
- Player has prep phase
- Player can see next wave contents
- Player must construct towers in their shop, by spending bunnies
    - Bunnies are gained indirectly by defeating enemies through [hat mechanic](#hat-mechanic)
- After a timer, wave starts (player may trigger early for bonus)
- Towers must defeat enemies generated by [wave generator mechanic](#wave-generator-mechanic).
- Player may use special one time effects from their small inventory
- Inventory is a list of 3 to 5 special bunnies that may be towers or one-off effects.
- After the attack wave ends, the player gets an X seconds prep phase and the whole loop restarts

### Wave Generator Mechanic
- Game tracks all mana received by the player.
- Total mana received acts as budget for wave generator to buy enemies.
- When choosing enemies, cheaper enemies are weighted more propable.
- OPTIONAL: Certain wave numbers unlock new enemy types.

### Hat Mechanic
- Hat needs to be charged with mana
- Mana is gained by defeating evil wizard summons
- player clicks hat to cash out mana and hat spits out bunnies and mana resets
    - Higher mana bar leads and more currency
    - Bunnies are either currency (white bunny) or special one-off effects, passive upgrades and special towers (rare bunnies)
    - Inventory is a FIFO queue where the old items are auto discarded to make space (forces player to act and spend them)
- Player can set hat to \[Low, Med, Big\] charge
    - Lower charge results in normal bunny generation
    - Higher charge increases chance for rare bunnies, but also for stronger attacks
